Species included in the project are those which, as of September 2018, had a global conservation status of G1 (critical imperiled) or G2 (imperiled) or which are listed as threatened or endangered at the full species level under the United States Endangered Species Act. Taxonomic groups included in the project are vertebrates (birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, turtles, crocodilians, and freshwater and anadromous fishes), vascular plants, selected aquatic invertebrates (freshwater mussels and crayfish) and selected pollinators (bumblebees, butterflies, and skippers).\\n\\nThere are three types of spatial data provided, described in more detail below: species richness, range-size rarity, and protection-weighted range-size rarity.  For each type, this data set includes five different layers &ndash; one for all species combined, and four additional tiffs that break the data down by taxonomic group (vertebrates, plants, freshwater invertebrates, and pollinators) &ndash; for a total of fifteen layers.\\n\\nThese data layers are intended to identify areas of high potential value for on-the-ground biodiversity protection efforts. As a synthesis of predictive models, they cannot guarantee either the presence or absence of imperiled species at a given location. For site-specific decision-making, these data should be used in conjunction with field surveys and/or documented occurrence data, such as is available from the NatureServe Network.\\n\n direct_access: True\n user_parameters: []\n metadata: \n args: \n   stac_obj: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1/collections/mobi,\n 'io-lulc': name: io-lulc\n container: catalog\n plugin: ['stac_catalog']\n driver: ['stac_catalog']\n description: Global estimates of 10-class land use/land cover (LULC) for 2020, derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution.

Species included in the project are those which, as of September 2018, had a global conservation status of G1 (critical imperiled) or G2 (imperiled) or which are listed as threatened or endangered at the full species level under the United States Endangered Species Act. Taxonomic groups included in the project are vertebrates (birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, turtles, crocodilians, and freshwater and anadromous fishes), vascular plants, selected aquatic invertebrates (freshwater mussels and crayfish) and selected pollinators (bumblebees, butterflies, and skippers).\\n\\nThere are three types of spatial data provided, described in more detail below: species richness, range-size rarity, and protection-weighted range-size rarity.  For each type, this data set includes five different layers &ndash; one for all species combined, and four additional tiffs that break the data down by taxonomic group (vertebrates, plants, freshwater invertebrates, and pollinators) &ndash; for a total of fifteen layers.\\n\\nThese data layers are intended to identify areas of high potential value for on-the-ground biodiversity protection efforts. As a synthesis of predictive models, they cannot guarantee either the presence or absence of imperiled species at a given location. For site-specific decision-making, these data should be used in conjunction with field surveys and/or documented occurrence data, such as is available from the NatureServe Network.\\n\n direct_access: True\n user_parameters: []\n metadata: \n args: \n   stac_obj: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1/collections/mobi,\n 'io-lulc': name: io-lulc\n container: catalog\n plugin: ['stac_catalog']\n driver: ['stac_catalog']\n description: Global estimates of 10-class land use/land cover (LULC) for 2020, derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution.
