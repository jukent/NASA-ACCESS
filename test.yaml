      from [The National Map](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/national-map)
      are the primary elevation data product produced and distributed by the USGS.
      The 3DEP program provides a variety of resolution raster elevation data of the
      conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the island territories. Some
      of the data sets such as the 1/3rd arc-second and 1 arc-second data set are
      derived from diverse source data sets that are processed to a specification
      with a consistent resolution, coordinate system, elevation units, and horizontal
      and vertical datums.\n\nThe seamless DEM layers under the 3DEP program are a
      multi-resolution dataset that is updated continuously to integrate newly available,
      improved elevation source data. Seamless DEM data layers under the 3DEP program  are
      available nationally at grid spacings of 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters)
      for the conterminous United States, and at 1/3, 1/9 arc-seconds  (approximately
      10 and 3 meters, respectively) and 1 meter for parts of the United States. Most
      seamless DEM data for Alaska is available at 2-arc-second (about 60 meters)
      grid spacing, where only lower resolution source data exist. Part of Alaska
      is available at the 1/3 arc-second, 1 arc-second and 5 meter resolution.\n

      of nightly VIIRS satellite imagery. Specifically, this dataset provides the
      following annual values at country-level granularity:\n\n1. **Access**: Predicted
      likelihood that a settlement is electrified, based on night-by-night comparisons
      of each settlement against matched uninhabited areas over a calendar year.\n\n2.
      **Reliability**: Proportion of nights a settlement is statistically brighter
      than matched uninhabited areas. Areas with more frequent power outages or service
      interruptions have lower rates.\n\n3. **Usage**: Higher levels of brightness
      indicate more robust usage of outdoor lighting, which is highly correlated with
      overall energy consumption.\n\n4. **Nighttime Lights**: Annual composites of
      VIIRS nighttime light output.\n\nFor more information and methodology, please

      both the intra and inter-annual variability and changes.\n- __Occurrence Change
      Intensity__: provides information on where surface water occurrence increased,
      decreased or remained the same between 1984-1999 and 2000-2020. Both the direction
      of change and its intensity are documented.\n\n- __Seasonality__: provides information
      concerning the intra-annual behaviour of water surfaces for a single year (2020)
      and shows permanent and seasonal water and the number of months water was present.\n\n-
      __Recurrence__: provides information concerning the inter-annual behavior of
      water surfaces and captures the frequency with which water returns from year
      to year.\n\n- __Transitions__: The Transitions map provides information on the
      change in seasonality between the first and last years and captures changes
      between the three classes of not water, seasonal water and permanent water.\n\n-
      __Maximum water extent__: The Maximum Water Extent provides information on all

      Landsat 8 data from [Landsat Collection 2](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-2).  Because
      there is some latency before Level-2 data is available, a rolling window of
      recent Level-1 data is available as well.  Images are stored in [cloud-optimized
      GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.\n'

    description: 'The [Map of Biodiversity Importance](https://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/projects/map-biodiversity-importance)
      (MoBI) consists of a series of raster maps that combine habitat information
      for 2,216 imperiled species occurring in the conterminous United States, using
      weightings based on range size and degree of protection to identify areas of
      high importance for biodiversity conservation. Species included in the project
      are those which, as of September 2018, had a global conservation status of G1
      (critical imperiled) or G2 (imperiled) or which are listed as threatened or
      endangered at the full species level under the United States Endangered Species
      Act. Taxonomic groups included in the project are vertebrates (birds, mammals,
      amphibians, reptiles, turtles, crocodilians, and freshwater and anadromous fishes),
      vascular plants, selected aquatic invertebrates (freshwater mussels and crayfish)
      and selected pollinators (bumblebees, butterflies, and skippers).\n\nThere are
      three types of spatial data provided, described in more detail below: species
      richness, range-size rarity, and protection-weighted range-size rarity.  For
      each type, this data set includes five different layers &ndash; one for all
      species combined, and four additional tiffs that break the data down by taxonomic
      group (vertebrates, plants, freshwater invertebrates, and pollinators) &ndash;
      for a total of fifteen layers.\n\nThese data layers are intended to identify
      areas of high potential value for on-the-ground biodiversity protection efforts.
      As a synthesis of predictive models, they cannot guarantee either the presence
      or absence of imperiled species at a given location. For site-specific decision-making,
      these data should be used in conjunction with field surveys and/or documented
      occurrence data, such as is available from the NatureServe Network.\n'
